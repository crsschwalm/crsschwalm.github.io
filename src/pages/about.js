            <p>
              I am Carson Schwalm. Web Developer by day, husband and doggo dad
              by night. <br /> Currently working at DMI in Indianapolis as a
              Senior Software Engineer consulting for clients in the Indy area
              such as Eli Lilly & KAR. <br />
              <br />
              I'm on new projects often, but love the process of solutioning
              with team members and writing <em>Clean Code</em>.
